Set up project foundation and clean architecture

## Overview
This issue establishes the fundamental project structure and implements clean architecture principles to ensure maintainable, scalable code organization.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create core directory structure (data, domain, presentation layers)
- [ ] Set up dependency injection framework
- [ ] Implement repository pattern interfaces
- [ ] Configure logging and error handling
- [ ] Set up unit testing framework

- [ ] All layers are properly separated with clear boundaries
- [ ] Dependency injection is configured and working
- [ ] Repository pattern is implemented for data access
- [ ] Comprehensive logging is in place
- [ ] Unit test framework is set up with sample tests
- [ ] Architecture documentation is complete

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Architecture diagram created

## Labels
foundation, architecture, setup

## Estimated Effort
3-5 days
